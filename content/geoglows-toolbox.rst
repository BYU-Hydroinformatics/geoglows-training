GEOGloWS Toolbox with Tethys
============================

Click on the following link to view a presentation that introduces the GEOGloWS Toolbox: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ur45mm11KcIYxz0rEHVMxO7loHWobvCtclcV5BW9nsU/edit?usp=sharing

This lesson introduces the open source web app development platform and how it has been used in the NASA SERVIR and
GEOGloWS projects to create a basic “Toolbox” of global water sustainability apps for the end users and stakeholders.
These can be configured as a base set of tools on a Tethys Portal anywhere. After the presentation there is a short
workshop that allows you to explore a few different apps.
