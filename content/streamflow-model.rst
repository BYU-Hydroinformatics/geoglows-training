GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Services
==================================

The GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Service uses a Hydrologic Modeling as a Service (HMaaS) approach, which centralizes the
cyberinfrastructure, human capacity, and other components of hydrologic modeling using the best forecasts and expertise
from ECMWF, along with the latest advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). It is a reliable
hydrologic forecast information as a service, a disruptive technology that moves away from needing to provide the
underlying data that must be synthesized and computed locally.

These tools, including the app, REST API, Python libraries and notebooks will help you learn how you can access,
visualize, and download hydrologic information for your location and develop custom workflows and apps for your
decision-making needs. Further, information about how to validate and improve the information based on local
observations is also given.
