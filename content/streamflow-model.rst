GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Services
==================================
Tutorial
--------
This tutorial will show how to use the GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Explorer App. Features include a forecast hydrograph
for each stream, historically simulated streamflows, and the ability to download time series.

View the Animated Forecast
--------------------------
1. Zoom in on an area that looks interesting and explore the buttons on the left hand side of the hydroviewer
