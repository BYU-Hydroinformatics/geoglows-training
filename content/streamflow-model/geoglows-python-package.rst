geoglows Python package
=======================

The same functions to access forecasts through the REST API have been created in a Python package called geoglows that
is documented at this site: https://geoglows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Functions for manipulating and plotting the data
are also included in addition to the functions that access the streamflow services through python code. The following
Google Colab Notebook provides example code for implementing this package.
