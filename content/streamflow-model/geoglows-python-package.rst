geoglows Python package
=======================

The same functions to access forecasts through the REST API have been created in a Python package called geoglows that
is documented at this site: https://geoglows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Besides access to the streamflow services
through python code, functions for manipulating and plotting the data are included. The following Google Colab Notebook
provides example code for implementing this package.
