GEOGloWS Training
=================
This website contains training materials, presentations, videos, workshops, code notebooks, and links to other resources
to learn about the use of the GEOGloWS Toolbox for accessing relevant global water information. The principal tool has
been the GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Services, but additional tools for discovering in situ observations,
multi-dimensional gridded time series data such as come from numerical weather models and groundwater are being added
and improved.

Overview
========
The `GEOGloWS initiative <https://www.geoglows.org/>`_ consolidates elements of freshwater activities in GEO. It ensures
that strong coordination and commitment are in place for links among data, information, knowledge, applications, and
policy. From research to implementation, GEOGloWS provides the demonstration grounds for user-driven solutions to
address water issues.
