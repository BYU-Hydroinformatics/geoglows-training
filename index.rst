GEOGloWS Training
=================
This website contains training materials, presentations, videos, workshops code notebooks, and links to other resources
to learn about use the GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Model.

Overview
========
The GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Service uses a Hydrologic Modeling as a Service (HMaaS) approach, which centralizes the
cyberinfrastructure, human capacity, and other components of hydrologic modeling using the best forecasts and expertise
available, along with the latest advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). We can now deliver reliable
forecast information as a service, instead of all the underlying data that must be synthesized and computed locally.
