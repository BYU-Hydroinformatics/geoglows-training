GEOGloWS Toolbox with Tethys
============================

This lesson introduces the open source web app development platform and how it has been used in the NASA SERVIR and
GEOGloWS projects to create a basic “Toolbox” of global water sustainability apps for the end users and stakeholders.
These can be configured as a base set of tools on a Tethys Portal anywhere. After the presentation there is a short
workshop that allows you to explore a few different apps.
