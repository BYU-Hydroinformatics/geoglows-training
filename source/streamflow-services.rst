GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Services
==================================

This presentation presents the development of the global streamflow historical and forecast services created from the
European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ensemble 15-day forecasts. The workshop allows you to explore
the available map and data services on any river in the world. Further you can explore how the streamflow services are
accessed through REST API services and/or a Python Package so that customization within research (Jupyter Notebooks) and
end user (Tethys) tools.
