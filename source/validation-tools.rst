Validation Tools for the GEOGloWS ECMWF Services
================================================

In this presentation and series of workshops you will learn about the HydroStats package that contains many different
metrics for measuring the goodness and validation of hydrologic models, particularly how observed data for hydrographs
can be compared with simulated data. You will learn how to use Python tools in Colab to access the streamflow services
and then perform validation with locally observed river flow data for the historical simulation. Further, you will learn
how to aggregate a series of forecasts as compared to observed data to evaluate the skill and better understand how to
interpret results.
